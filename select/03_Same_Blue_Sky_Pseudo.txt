I know it’s hard
But i think it’s finally time
To let fate run its course
And say goodbye
Oh, it hurts
Don’t leave me behind
Yeah life’s full of risks
And I want you to be mine
I wanna say
Thank you for all of the memories
All of those sleepless nights
Thank you for all of the melodies
You sang to me when I cried
Thank you to all of my family
All of the friends by my side
‘Coz I’ll miss you
I’ll miss you till the end of the line
I wish that I
Could turn back time
To the best days of my life
To feel things twice
To speak my mind
To treasure every moment with you by my side
I wish that I
Could turn back time
Just to feel your head on mine
To live my highs
To say goodbye
And even if fate isn’t on our side
I know we tried
Even if this is goodbye
Don’t be sad, don’t you cry
‘Coz the memories we made
Will always be by your side
Every time I cross your mind
Just look up and you’ll be fine
‘Coz even when we’re miles apart
We’ll be underneath the same blue sky
I wish that I
Could turn back time
To the best days of my life
To feel things twice
To speak my mind
To treasure every moment with you by my side
I wish that I
Could turn back time
Just to feel your head on mine
To live my highs
To say goodbye
And even if fate isn’t on our side
I know we tried
