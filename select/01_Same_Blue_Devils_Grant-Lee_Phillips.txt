All my funny pages
Cartoon Saturdays ago
Carved my number in the door
Oh my revelation
Railway summers overcast
And the creaking of the boards

No use draggin' down to the wire
Same blue devils leap from the fire
There's no easy come, easy go

Oh my happyender
Teacup manners under glass
My gravel blinded love
Oh my sorry jailer
Isn't nothin' here for you
To revel in the dust

No use draggin' down to the wire
Same blue devils leap from the fire
There's no easy come, easy go

Carved my number in the door

No use draggin' down to the wire
Same blue devils leap from the fire
There's no easy come, easy go
Easy come, easy go
Easy come, easy go
Easy come, easy go
